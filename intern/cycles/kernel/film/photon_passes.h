/* Photon caustics: per-pixel SPPM statistics (stochastic progressive photon
 * mapping, Hachisuka/Jensen 2009).
 *
 * The path kernel only records one measurement point per pixel and sample
 * (film_write_photon_hitpoint). The photon gather runs as a separate film
 * kernel exactly once per published photon generation, between render works
 * (film_photon_gather_pixel): it looks up the photon batch at the pixel's own
 * gather radius, then updates the pixel statistics in place
 *
 *   N'   = N + alpha * M
 *   r'^2 = r^2 * (N + alpha * M) / (N + M)
 *   tau' = (tau + f_r * Phi) * r'^2 / r^2
 *
 * so the radius only ever shrinks and the estimate converges in place instead
 * of relying on film averaging over independent batches. The shrink stops at
 * a radius floor of r0/4; from there on the estimate is a plain average of
 * constant-radius gathers (see the floor comment in the update below).
 *
 * The film shows the current SPPM state through a delta write into the
 * combined pass: with S samples accumulated, the pass holds S * E for the
 * current estimate E, so writing S * E_new - (previous write) makes the
 * running film average display E exactly. The last written sum lives in the
 * state pass, which also makes the write self-correcting. */
