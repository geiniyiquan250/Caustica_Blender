/* CyclesPlus: the photon map ADDS to Cycles' caustics, it does not replace
 * them.
 *
 * It used to replace them. Both estimators describe the same light, so
 * running both counts it twice - suppressing the path-traced side looked
 * like the obviously correct thing to do.
 *
 * It is not, and an interior water shot showed why (tester report
 * 2026-08-25). Cycles suppresses caustics by refusing to build the specular
 * closure once a path has gone diffuse, which is far broader than "the
 * caustic": a bathtub floor looks up THROUGH the water surface to collect
 * bounced wall light, and with that closure gone it sees black. The photon
 * map never replaced that light - it only carries what arrives over an
 * unbroken specular chain straight from a lamp. So we were switching off
 * something we do not deliver. Measured on that scene: 16% of lit pixels
 * dropped to a sixth of their brightness, the water going flat black.
 *
 * Outdoors this hid for months: sunlight dominates a pool, so the part that
 * went missing was small (the documented pool3 "-12% broad" note is the same
 * effect). Interiors live on bounced light, so there it takes nearly
 * everything.
 *
 * The double counting that motivated the suppression turns out to be minor,
 * because the paths a photon map is good at are exactly the ones the path
 * tracer almost never finds. Measured against ground truth (PT @4096sp, no
 * clamp, no glossy filter) across a hard sun, a 20-degree soft sun and a
 * large area light: adding lands 2-3.5% above truth, replacing 1-1.5% below
 * it. Both are close; only one of them turns interiors black.
 *
 * This is also what the renderers artists come from do - Corona runs its
 * caustics solver alongside the path tracer rather than in place of it.
 *
 * CYCLESPLUS_PHOTON_REPLACE_PT=1 restores the old behaviour for support. */
